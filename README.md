# 3D_decomposition
> This repository contains a few MatLab codes for converting SAR-derived displacement into true 3D displacement (EW, NS and UD directions)   
- Main converting program: InSAR3Ddisp.m  
- Removing noisy pixels: Deno.m  
- Regrid the grds to the same size: Regrid.m  
- Reading grds: grdread2.m   from Kelsey Jordahl (2022).(https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25683-grdread2)
