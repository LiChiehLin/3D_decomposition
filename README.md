# 3D_decomposition
> This repository contains a few MatLab codes for converting SAR-derived displacement into true 3D displacement (EW, NS and UD directions)  
> These codes were developed under MatLab 2015b  


- Read grd: grdread2.m  
> The code for reading netCDF grds is from Kelsey Jordahl (2022). grdread2 (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25683-grdread2), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved August 30, 2022.
